# gmail-login-selenium
Bypass secure browser block on selenium, and login to gmail. Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. (sorry for the messy code)

DM ME ON DISCORD @tovi#0001 to talk about coding/this bypass or anytihng of that sort :) (add me as a friend)

Why it works:

This works by using the 'DN' user agent. This user agent is old, so it pulls up old google login. This login does not block selenium!
